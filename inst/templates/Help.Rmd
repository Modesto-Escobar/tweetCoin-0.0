Each **nodes** or circles are responses or categories of variables. Their sizes are proportional to their frequency in the sample. The **links** are associations between responses. Their width is proportional to the degree of association between them measured with normalized Haberman residuals.

The **spatial arrangement** of the circles is based on a physical attraction-repulsion mechanism called Fruchterman-Reingold in honor of those who proposed it.

This **graphic** is interactive, so many of its features can be changed. A partial list of what can be done is presented at the bottom of this page.

The three most useful operations that can be performed on nodes are selection, filter, and isolation. By **selecting**, the nodes are marked with a yellow circle and the information about them appears in the table below. Once selected, they can be highlighted in two ways: a) isolating them from the rest (**isolate**), or b) filtering them together with their neighbors (**filter**).
